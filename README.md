# Restaurant Visitor Prediction using Machine Learning Algorithm

# Project Overview
This project was intended to go deeper into machine learning prediction aglorithms and implement it to predict the number of visitors to the restaurant on a particular given day.
The dataset used for this project was taken from kaggle website.

# Approach and steps performed to predict the restaurant visitors

# Step 1 Data cleaning and processing
1. In this step first checked for the inaccurate and missing data records for different csv files.
2. Replaced and modified the incorrect data with the mean data, also normailzed the data records for smooth accuracy in prediction at later stage.
3. Dataset consists of data from two websites so the data needs to be merged to apply ML algorithm over combined data. Dataset was large enough so used the Hadoop Mapreduce to perform normalization and merging of the data of the two websites.

# Step 2 Regression Analysis of data 

# Step 3 Building the Training Model

# Step 4 Performing ML algorithm over the Training dataset to predict restaurant visitors

# Step 5 Hosting and Deployment of Application
